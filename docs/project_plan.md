# Procedural Planet Generator - Project Plan

*A comprehensive simulation system for scientifically-grounded world creation*

## Project Overview

The Procedural Planet Generator is a scientific simulation system that models the formation and evolution of planets from initial formation through billions of years of geological, climatic, and ecological development. The system creates scientifically plausible worlds for worldbuilding applications in video games, fiction, tabletop RPGs, and other creative works.

### Key Capabilities

- Simulate planetary formation and tectonic plate movement over billions of years
- Generate realistic terrain based on geological processes
- Model climate systems including atmosphere, temperature, and precipitation
- Create biomes and ecological zones based on climate data
- Allow users to select specific regions (e.g., 200km Ã— 200km) and export heightmaps for use in game engines
- Provide comprehensive data for worldbuilding beyond just physical geography
