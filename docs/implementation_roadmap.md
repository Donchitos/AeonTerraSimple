# AeonTerra C++ Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status

So far, we've developed:
- Comprehensive technical documentation
- Architecture design 
- Example implementations for advanced features
- Integration strategy

However, these are primarily planning documents and conceptual examples. The core functionality still needs to be implemented before we can run a complete simulation.

## What's Still Needed

### 1. Core Implementation

We need to implement these core components:

- **SphericalGrid Class**
  - Implementation of the geodesic grid
  - Spatial indexing for neighbor queries
  - Vertex and face data structures

- **Planet Class**
  - Elevation data storage
  - Crust type and properties
  - Interface for terrain modification

- **Tectonics System**
  - Plate creation and management
  - Plate movement simulation
  - Boundary interactions (subduction, collision, etc.)

- **Erosion System**
  - Water flow simulation
  - Weathering processes
  - Sediment transport

### 2. Build System Setup

- Complete CMakeLists.txt files for all components
- Build script to compile with proper dependencies
- Test framework integration

### 3. Python Bindings

- Pybind11 wrappers for all C++ classes
- Numpy array integration for data transfer
- Python-friendly interface design

### 4. Visualization Tools

- Heightmap export functionality
- Integration with existing visualization utilities
- Simple web viewer for remote workspace usage

## Running Simulations in a Remote Workspace

Yes, you can view simulation results in a GitHub Codespace or other remote workspace using the following approaches:

### Option 1: Image Export

```cpp
// C++ code to export visualization
void HeightmapGenerator::exportGrayscaleImage(const std::string& path, int resolution) {
    // Convert heightmap to image
    // Save to file system
}
```

```python
# Python code to run and view
generator = aeon.HeightmapGenerator(params)
generator.run_tectonic_simulation(100)
generator.export_grayscale_image("terrain.png", 1024)
# You can view terrain.png in the VS Code interface
```

### Option 2: Web Visualization

We can create a simple HTML/JavaScript viewer that reads heightmap data from a file:

```python
# Generate JSON data for web viewer
generator.export_web_data("terrain_data.json")
# Run simple HTTP server
import http.server
import socketserver
PORT = 8000
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler) as httpd:
    print(f"Serving at port {PORT}")
    httpd.serve_forever()
# Access through port forwarding in GitHub Codespaces
```

### Option 3: ASCII Visualization

For quick debugging, we can generate ASCII art visualization that works directly in the terminal:

```python
generator.print_ascii_visualization()
# Outputs terrain as ASCII art in the terminal
```

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Core Spherical Grid | 1 week |
| 2 | Planet and Basic Tectonics | 2 weeks |
| 3 | Erosion System | 1 week |
| 4 | Python Bindings | 1 week |
| 5 | Build System and Integration | 1 week |
| 6 | Visualization | 1 week |

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Implement the SphericalGrid class (the foundation of everything else)
2. Create the Planet class with elevation data
3. Setup the build system for these core components
4. Implement basic Python bindings
5. Create a simple test program to verify functionality

Once these steps are complete, we'll have a minimal working system that can be expanded with the advanced features we've designed in our example implementations.
