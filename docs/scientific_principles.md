# Scientific Principles in AeonTerra

This document outlines the key scientific principles that form the foundation of the AeonTerra planet generation system.

## Planetary Formation

### Core & Mantle Formation
- **Planetary Differentiation**: The separation of a planet into distinct layers (core, mantle, crust) based on density.
- **Heat Sources**: Radioactive decay and gravitational energy from formation provide the heat that drives later processes.

### Initial Crust Formation
- **Primary Crust**: Forms directly from cooling of the initial magma ocean.
- **Continental vs. Oceanic Crust**: Continental crust is thicker (25-70 km) and less dense (2.7 g/cm³) than oceanic crust (5-10 km thick, 3.0 g/cm³).

## Plate Tectonics

### Mantle Convection
- **Convection Cells**: Hot material rises from the core-mantle boundary, cools near the surface, and sinks back down.
- **Mantle Plumes**: Focused upwellings of hot material that can persist for hundreds of millions of years.

### Plate Motion
- **Driving Forces**: Slab pull (subducting plates pull the rest of the plate), ridge push (elevated ridges pushing outward), and mantle drag.
- **Plate Velocities**: Typically range from 1-10 cm/year, with oceanic plates generally moving faster than continental ones.

### Plate Boundaries
1. **Convergent Boundaries**
   - **Continental-Continental**: Creates mountain ranges (orogeny) through compression (e.g., Himalayas).
   - **Oceanic-Continental**: Oceanic plate subducts, creating continental volcanic arcs and deep trenches (e.g., Andes).
   - **Oceanic-Oceanic**: One plate subducts beneath another, creating island arcs and trenches (e.g., Mariana Islands).

2. **Divergent Boundaries**
   - **Continental Rifting**: Continents split apart, creating rift valleys that may develop into ocean basins (e.g., East African Rift).
   - **Seafloor Spreading**: New oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge).

3. **Transform Boundaries**
   - Plates slide past each other horizontally, creating strike-slip faults (e.g., San Andreas Fault).

### Wilson Cycle
- The cycle of ocean basin opening and closing, involving continent rifting, ocean formation, subduction, and continental collision.

## Isostasy

- **Principle**: Buoyancy of the crust floating on the denser mantle.
- **Airy Model**: Thicker crust extends deeper into the mantle but rises higher above sea level.
- **Pratt Model**: Less dense crust rises higher above sea level than denser crust.

## Erosion and Sedimentation

### Weathering
- **Mechanical**: Physical breakdown of rocks through temperature changes, frost action, etc.
- **Chemical**: Decomposition of rock through chemical reactions with air, water, etc.

### Transport and Deposition
- **Fluvial Processes**: Rivers erode, transport, and deposit sediments, creating valleys and deltas.
- **Glacial Processes**: Ice sheets and glaciers erode mountains and deposit material in moraines.
- **Coastal Processes**: Waves erode coastlines and form beaches.

## Climate Systems

### Atmospheric Circulation
- **Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar Cells**: Major atmospheric circulation patterns.
- **Coriolis Effect**: Deflection of air and water due to Earth's rotation.
- **Jet Streams**: Fast-flowing air currents that affect weather patterns.

### Ocean Circulation
- **Surface Currents**: Wind-driven currents that affect coastal climates.
- **Thermohaline Circulation**: Deep ocean circulation driven by temperature and salinity differences.
- **Gyres**: Large systems of rotating ocean currents.

### Precipitation
- **Orographic Precipitation**: Rain/snow caused when air is forced upward by mountains.
- **Convective Precipitation**: Rain from rising warm air currents (thunderstorms).
- **Frontal Precipitation**: Rain/snow at boundaries between air masses.

## Biome Classification

- **Temperature and Precipitation**: The primary factors determining biome types.
- **Köppen Climate Classification**: System for categorizing climate regions.
- **Elevation Effects**: Changes in temperature and precipitation with altitude create vertical biome zonation.
